                <p class ='text'>I've been doing art since I was a kid, and it's something that I've found a great love for. I draw regularly, and I love sculpure, especially clay and wood.</p>
                <p class='text'>At Northwestern, I've been able to take a sculpture class, which is where these sculptures come from.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class='text'>"A Work in Progress", the work that came from a prompt asking us to recall an impactful time in our pasts. I thought back to my senior year of high school and how I grew so much that year. The half-head is a nod to the ceramics class I took that year and the large number of faces that I sculpted.</li>
                    <li class='text'>"Leap", this piece came from a major project in which we were asked to evoke movement and emotion from an immobile wood piece. I was inspired by dancers and birds, and I loved the idea of playing with negative space. I was also able to repurpose the boxes into shoe racks for my dorm room.</li>
